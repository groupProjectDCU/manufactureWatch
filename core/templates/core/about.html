    <!-- How It Works Section -->
    <section class="bg-light py-5">
        <div class="container text-center">
            <h2>How the System Works</h2>
            <p>1. Machines are monitored continuously, and statuses are updated in real-time.</p>
            <p>2. When a fault is detected, a technician logs the issue, and a unique fault case is created.</p>
            <p>3. The repair team works on the case, adding updates and marking the fault as resolved once fixed.</p>
            <p>4. Managers oversee the entire process, generate reports, and manage machine and technician assignments.</p>
